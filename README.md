## Compiler_Construction_Upgraded
- Compiler constructed for a custom-defined langauge ERPLAG which is a strongly typed language with primitive data types as integer and floating point. It also supports two other data types: boolean and arrays. The language supports arithmetic and boolean expressions. The language supports assignment statements, input/output statements, declarative, conditional, iterative, and function call statements. The language supports the modular implementation of the functionalities. Functions can return multiple values. The function may or may not return a value as well. The scope of the variables is static and the variable is visible only in the block where it is declared. The language is designed for the course CS F363 (Compiler Construction)
